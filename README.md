# gke-cluster-demo
## Overview
  
This project demonstrates how to deploy and manage a Kubernetes cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). It includes sample manifests, deployment scripts, and instructions to help you get started quickly.

## Features

- Automated GKE cluster provisioning
- Integration with Google Cloud CLI and kubectl
- Example Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, etc.)
- Development Vault Deployment
- Prometheus Monitoring Stack Deployment
- Scripts for docker image generation and upload to GAR (Google Artifact Registry). Preveously known as GCR (Google Container Registry).
- Guidance for authentication and access control

## Prerequisites

- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/gke-cluster-demo.git
    cd eks-cluster-demo
    ```

2. **Configure Google Cloud SDK:**
    ```sh
    gcloud init
    ```

3. **Create the GKE cluster and deploy manifests:**
    ```sh
    make tf-bucket
    make tf-tasks
    make tf-apply
    ```

4. **Deploy workloads on the fly (optional):**
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f manifests/
    ```

5. **Access the cluster:**
    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

## Tools Used

- **Terraform**: AWS infrastructure provisioning.
- **gcloud**: Google Cloud CLI.
- **helm**: Kubernetes package manager.
- **eksctl**: Simplifies EKS cluster creation and management.
- **kubectl**: Command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

## Cleanup

To delete the EKS cluster and associated resources:
```sh
    make tf-destroy
```
